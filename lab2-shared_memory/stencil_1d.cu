/**
 * @brief 1D stencil computation using shared memory.
 * 
 * This CUDA kernel applies a 1D stencil operation to an input array. 
 * Each thread computes the sum of its neighboring elements (defined by the RADIUS) 
 * and writes the result into an output array. Shared memory is used to reduce the number 
 * of global memory accesses by loading a block of data plus a halo region into shared memory.
 *
 * @param in   Pointer to the input array in device memory. The input array is expected 
 *             to have halo regions on both sides of size RADIUS to accommodate boundary conditions.
 * @param out  Pointer to the output array in device memory. The result of the stencil computation
 *             will be written to this array.
 *
 * Details:
 * - Shared memory is allocated to hold a block of input elements plus additional elements 
 *   for the halo regions (left and right of the block). 
 * - Each thread loads one element from the input array into shared memory.
 * - Threads at the boundaries of the block also load the halo elements into shared memory.
 * - After loading, all threads synchronize to ensure that shared memory is fully populated.
 * - Each thread then computes the sum of the element at its position and its neighbors 
 *   within the RADIUS. The result is written into the output array at the corresponding position.
 *
 * Block and Grid Dimensions:
 * - Block size is defined by BLOCK_SIZE (e.g., 16 threads per block).
 * - Grid size is determined by dividing the array size (N) by BLOCK_SIZE.
 *
 * @note The input array `in` should have extra elements to account for the halo regions. 
 * The kernel operates on the non-halo region of the array (in + RADIUS to out + RADIUS).
